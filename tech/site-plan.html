        DTS: Dedicated Technology Solutions - Your answer for customized solutions.
        </br>
        DTS provides customized solutions for your particular needs.  We get your requirements, then plan out and find the appropriate technology.
        Once you let us know what you need, whether that be security monitoring, atmospheric readings, tracking inventory, remotely controlling heaters/sprinklers/cooling/garage doors
        we can customize a product for you.  We specialize in remote access via wifi or cellular data, including logging of what occurred and when.  Solar powered systems are available
        as well for your remote locations.
        </br>
        After figuring out what is needed for your project, we will both provide you with an initial product, as well as the BoM (Bill of Materials) and any code needed to make the 
        product work. We will have everything programmed and documented so that you can begin producing the product yourself, or if you would prefer we can produce and program them
        for you and deliver them.
        </br>
        See our project pages for an example of an off the grid camera system, and a wifi thermostat with advanced monitoring.
        </br>
        We can be contacted for projects at matthudrlik@gmail.com
